\chapter{Introduction}

The main goal of this work is to develop an interpreter for Feature
Featherweight Java~\cite{Igarashi99featherweightjava}, in the future it will be
provided a formal proof of its soundness in Coq.

But before delving through the definition of FFJ we will first provide
important formal definition to better understand the motivation of our work.

In the Chapter 2 we will provide the theoretical background behind programming
languages, Chapter 3 we discuss our implementation decisions for the project.
