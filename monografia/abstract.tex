Specifying a language using an \ac{ITP} is seldom faithful
to its original pen-and-paper specification. However, the process of mechanizing a
language and type safety proofs might also unearth insights for improving the original 
specification. In this paper, we detail some design decisions related to our process 
of first specifying \textit{\ac{FJ}} in \texttt{Coq} and thus evolving 
such a specification to prove the type system properties of 
an overhaul version \textit{\ac{FFJ}}---a core-calculus for a family of 
languages that address variability management in highly configurable systems, 
such as software product lines (SPLs); which we name as \textit{\ac{FFJ+}}. Indeed, \ac{FFJ+} 
is the first mechanization of \ac{FFJ}, and as such it might also help researchers to 
derive proofs about software product line refinements without considering several 
assumptions about the underlining SPL assets. We believe 
that the whole process led us to a clearer, unambiguous, and equivalent syntax and semantics of 
\ac{FFJ}, while keeping the proofs as well as our \ac{FJ} extensions as simple as possible.
